# PayPal iOS Demo App - SDK & Payment Link Integration

This repository contains a **SwiftUI demo application** that simulates a real-world merchant experience — including a cart and payment/checkout flow. It also demonstrates the steps to receive payments for in-app purchases through direct integration with PayPal. This can be used for both one time and recurring payments (for example: monthly subscriptions).
Its primary purpose is to **demonstrate two integration options** to accept payments in iOS Apps through PayPal:

1. **Direct SDK integration**, offering seamless in-app checkout using native components.
2. **Payment Links integration**, which redirects users to a PayPal hosted checkout experience via universal links.  

By providing practical examples for both approaches, this app helps developers choose the method that best fits their needs while simplifying implementation.

  - Go to `Checkout` tab and select if shipping address is required (It can be turned off for digital goods)
  - Go to `Confirmation` tab and use the universal link as `Auto-return URL` to redirect your customer to your app after they complete the payment
    - This is used to redirect users back to your app automatically through universal links after they complete a payment
    - It can be used for improving the user experience and ensuring smooth post-payment flow
- Click `Build It`
- To find/view the previously created links, click on [Back to saved links and buttons](https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/buttons/saved)

### 🌐 Steps to setup universal links
- To support universal linking — allowing your app to automatically handle return URLs after a user completes a PayPal Payment Link — follow the steps below.
  - Host the Apple App Site Association (AASA) file
    Create the `apple-app-site-association` file
    To enable universal linking, create a file named **`apple-app-site-association`** (with no `.json` extension) and include the following content:

    ```json
    {
      "applinks": {
        "details": [
          {
            "appIDs": [ "YOUR_TEAM_ID.YOUR_BUNDLE_ID" ],
            "components": [
              {
                "/": "/pay/success*",
                "comment": "Matches return URLs like /pay/success"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

    - Replace `YOUR_TEAM_ID` with your Apple Developer Team ID.
    - Replace `YOUR_BUNDLE_ID` with your app's bundle identifier.

    - Host this file at the root of your domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/apple-app-site-association`) to allow iOS to verify your app's association with the domain.
      Must be served with Content-Type: application/json and no redirects
      Use a valid HTTPS certificate
- Enable Associated Domains in your app
  - Open Xcode and go to your app target -> Signing & Capabilities
  - Add a new capability: Associated Domains
  - Add the following entry:
   ```json
   applinks:yourdomain.com
   ```
  - Do not inlcude https://
- Handle the return URL in your app  
  - SwiftUI Example:
    Use the .onOpenURL modifier to handle the return:
  ```swift
  @main
  struct PayPalDemoApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            CheckoutFlow()
                .onOpenURL { url in
                    if url.path.contains("/pay/success") {
                        // Parse query params and handle success
                    }
                }
        }
    }
  }
  ```
  - UIKit Example:
    - In AppDelegate:
    ```swift
    func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                 continue userActivity: NSUserActivity,
                 restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {
    guard userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb,
          let url = userActivity.webpageURL else { return false }
    // Handle payment success or failure
    return true
    }
    ```
    - In SceneDelegate.swift:
    ```
    func scene(_ scene: UIScene,
           continue userActivity: NSUserActivity) {
      if let url = userActivity.webpageURL {
        // Handle navigation or update state
      }
    }
    ```

### 🔙 Steps to receive payment data through Auto-Return URL
- PDT (Payment Data Transfer) with Auto-Return URL is a combination of two PayPal features that will help you manage post-payment processes seamlessly
- These features work together to ensure that after a user makes a payment, they are automatically redirected to your app, and you receive all relevant payment information for processing/display
- It has transaction details such as currency (`cc`), amount (`amt`), transaction id (`tx`) and status (`st`)
- Implement PDT on your Server
  - PDT allows you to retrieve detailed transaction data from PayPal after the payment is made
  - Once the customer is redirected back to your Auto Return URL, you can use the transaction ID (`tx`) parameter in the URL to make a server-side request to PayPal
  - PayPal will then send you the transaction details via a secure HTTP request
- To turn it ON
  - Click on `Account Settings` in top-right corner of the navigation menu
  - In the left menu, click `Website payments` (under `Products & Services`)
  - Then click `Update` next to `Website preferences`
  - Update `Payment data transfer` section

### 🔔 Steps to receive payment notification through Webhooks
- Using PayPal Webhooks allows your application to be automatically notified when specific events occur in your PayPal account—like a successful payment, subscription renewal, or refund
- It can be used by Merchants for real-time backend updates

## 📂 Project Structure

- **Where to find key logic**<br>
If you are just interested in code to implement server side and SDK API calls, you can skip to `CardPaymentViewModel` or `PayPalViewModel`
- **CheckoutFlow**<br>
SwiftUI view that is the entry point for the checkout process. It sets up the overall navigation structure using a `NavigationStack`, so users can move from cart checkout and finally OrderCompletion
- **CheckoutCoordinator (Navigation and Flow Manager)**<br>
Handles navigation logic and handles loading and error states of flows that do not have a dedicated SwiftUI view (e.g., PayPal Web Checkout)
- **CartView**<br>
Displays items in the cart and total amount<br>
Buttons to initiate Card or PayPalWeb checkout<br>
Tapping either calls into a `CheckoutCoordinator` that starts the respective flow
- **Card Checkout**<br>
This uses a SwiftUI screen called `CardCheckoutView` which references a `CardPaymentViewModel`<br>
The view model handles network calls for creating order, approving the card and final capture<br>
When complete, the user is navigated to `OrderCompleteView`
- **PayPal Web Checkout**<br>
No dedicated SwiftUI screen - once triggered, it opens a web flow
Because there is no dedicated PayPal view, we handle loading and errors in a `CheckoutCoordinator`<br>
If the user completes the PayPal flow, we capture the order and show `OrderCompleteView` 
- **Payment Links *(New)***<br>
Opens a universal link or URL that redirects to the hosted checkout.
 After completion, app is notified via webhook callback
