# PayPal iOS Demo App - SDK & Payment Link Integration

This repository contains a **SwiftUI demo application** that simulates a real-world merchant experience — including a cart and payment/checkout flow. It also demonstrates the steps to receive payments for in-app purchases through direct integration with PayPal. This can be used for both one time and recurring payments (for example: monthly subscriptions).
Its primary purpose is to **demonstrate two integration options** to accept payments in iOS Apps through PayPal:

1. **Direct SDK integration**, offering seamless in-app checkout using native components.
2. **Payment Link integration**, which redirects users to a PayPal hosted checkout experience via universal links.  

By providing practical examples for both approaches, this app helps developers choose the method that best fits their needs while simplifying implementation.

### 🔙 Steps to receive payment data through Auto-Return URL
- PDT (Payment Data Transfer) with Auto-Return URL is a combination of two PayPal features that will help you manage post-payment processes seamlessly
- These features work together to ensure that after a user makes a payment, they are automatically redirected to your app, and you receive all relevant payment information for processing/display
- It has transaction details such as currency (`cc`), amount (`amt`), transaction id (`tx`) and status (`st`)
- Implement PDT on your Server
  - PDT allows you to retrieve detailed transaction data from PayPal after the payment is made
  - Once the customer is redirected back to your Auto Return URL, you can use the transaction ID (`tx`) parameter in the URL to make a server-side request to PayPal
  - PayPal will then send you the transaction details via a secure HTTP request
- To turn it ON
  - Click on `Account Settings` in top-right corner of the navigation menu
  - In the left menu, click `Website payments` (under `Products & Services`)
  - Then click `Update` next to `Website preferences`
  - Update `Payment data transfer` section

### 🔔 Steps to receive payment notification through Webhooks
- Using PayPal Webhooks allows your application to be automatically notified when specific events occur in your PayPal account—like a successful payment, subscription renewal, or refund
- It can be used by Merchants for real-time backend updates

## 📂 Project Structure

- **Where to find key logic**<br>
If you are just interested in code to implement server side and SDK API calls, you can skip to `CardPaymentViewModel` or `PayPalViewModel`
- **CheckoutFlow**<br>
SwiftUI view that is the entry point for the checkout process. It sets up the overall navigation structure using a `NavigationStack`, so users can move from cart checkout and finally OrderCompletion
- **CheckoutCoordinator (Navigation and Flow Manager)**<br>
Handles navigation logic and handles loading and error states of flows that do not have a dedicated SwiftUI view (e.g., PayPal Web Checkout)
- **CartView**<br>
Displays items in the cart and total amount<br>
Buttons to initiate Card or PayPalWeb checkout<br>
Tapping either calls into a `CheckoutCoordinator` that starts the respective flow
- **Card Checkout**<br>
This uses a SwiftUI screen called `CardCheckoutView` which references a `CardPaymentViewModel`<br>
The view model handles network calls for creating order, approving the card and final capture<br>
When complete, the user is navigated to `OrderCompleteView`
- **PayPal Web Checkout**<br>
No dedicated SwiftUI screen - once triggered, it opens a web flow
Because there is no dedicated PayPal view, we handle loading and errors in a `CheckoutCoordinator`<br>
If the user completes the PayPal flow, we capture the order and show `OrderCompleteView` 
- **Payment Links *(New)***<br>
Opens a universal link or URL that redirects to the hosted checkout.
 After completion, app is notified via webhook callback
